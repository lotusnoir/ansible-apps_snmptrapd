         to connect an LT or a subtending ihub to.
         This attribute can only be modified for ports where tmnxPortMode 
         field of tmnxPortTable is set to access and which are not connected
         to a LT port. For ports where tmnxPortMode is equal to network, this field
         is fixed set to 'regular'. For LT ports, this field is fixed set to 
         'residential'.
         Setting this attribute will have impact on MAC Movement : a MAC 
         address that is learned on a port can't move to a port that is of
         the Residential Type. Next to the MAC Movement, the fadPortExtType
         also influences the user2user communication. Communication from a
