        A card port number (cpn) has significance within the context
        of the card on which it resides(ie., cpn 2 may exist in one or
        more cards in the chassis).  Whereas, portid is an
        unique/absolute port number (apn) within a given chassis.
        
        An 'invalid portid' is a TmnxPortID with a value of 0x1e000000 as

     IP OPTION NUMBERS

     The Internet Protocol (IP) has provision for optional header fields
     identified by an option type field.  Options 0 and 1 are exactly one
     octet which is their type field.  All other options have their one
     octet type field, followed by a one octet length field, followed by
     length-2 octets of option data.  The option type field is sub-divided
     into a one bit copied flag, a two bit class field, and a five bit
     option number.  These taken together form an eight bit value for the
     option type field.  IP options are commonly refered to by this value.

TItemScope ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual-convention determines some aspects of an item's
        behavior regarding creation and use, unused entry garbage collection,
        and automated promulgation by Element Management System to
        other systems in the service domain.

        TItemScope applies to SAP-ingress, SAP-egress, and Network policies,
        and to IP filters and MAC filters.

        exclusive:

            When the scope of an item is defined as exclusive, the item can
            only be applied once, for example to a single SAP.  Attempting
            to assign the policy to a second SAP is not allowed and will
            result in an error.  If the item is removed from the exclusive
            SAP, it will become available for assignment to another
            exclusive SAP.

            A non-applied exclusive scope policy is a candidate to be removed
            from the system by a TBD garbage collection command.

         preceding the queueing framework in the system.

         When the queue is operating in the 'profile' mode, in other

         appropriate bandwidth to the packets with different profiles.

         The profiles are assigned according to the configuration of the
         forwarding class or the sub-forwarding class.

         In 'priority' mode, the queue does not have the functionality
         to support the profiled traffic and in such cases the queue
         will have a degraded performance. However, the converse is not
