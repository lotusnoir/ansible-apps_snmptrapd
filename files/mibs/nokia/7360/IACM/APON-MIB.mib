--
--
--
--
-- John Boyle - 2/10/15:
-- For ISAM5.2
--
-- ALU01986788 - Completion of PON Utilization and Threshold (FWLT-A Part)
--
--	Commitment of this RCR was recently changed FROM Release 5.1.01 TO Release 5.3,
--	For all affected attributes, changed commentary as follows:
--		FROM: For NG-PON2 - SUPPORTED as of ISAM5.2.01 (for channel pairs)
--		TO: For NG-PON2 - NOT SUPPORTED as of ISAM5.2.01 (for channel pairs)
--
--
--
-- John Boyle - 1/29/15:
-- For ISAM5.2
--
-- RCR ALU01848928 - PON Utilization & Thresholds
--
--	For following attributes, changed lower end of range FROM 1 TO 0:
--	- gponSysOltSidePonUtilDbaCongestionThreshold SCALAR
--	- gponOltSidePonUtilDbaCongestionThreshold attribute in gponOltSidePonUtilTCAThresholdTable
--
-- John Boyle - 1/15/15:
-- For ISAM5.2
--
-- RCR ALU01848928 - PON Utilization & Thresholds
--
--	For all "utilization percentage" attributes in the following tables,
--	clarified the traffic composition of the denominators:
--		> gponOltSidePonUtilTxPmCurrentIntervalTable  
--		> gponOltSidePonUtilTxPmIntervalTable 
--		> gponOltSidePonUtilTxOntPmCurrentIntervalTable 
--		> gponOltSidePonUtilTxOntPmIntervalTable
--
-- John Boyle - 1/14/15:

--
-- RCR ALU01848928 - PON Utilization & Thresholds
--
--	For the following attributes:
--		> gponOltSidePonUtilTxPmCurrentIntervalUcastUtil 
--		> gponOltSidePonUtilTxPmCurrentIntervalBcastUtil 
--		> gponOltSidePonUtilTxPmIntervalUcastUtil 
--		> gponOltSidePonUtilTxPmIntervalBcastUtil 
--		> gponOltSidePonUtilTxOntPmCurrentIntervalUtil 
--		> gponOltSidePonUtilTxOntPmIntervalUtil
--
--	Increased their upper range FROM 10000 (100.00%) TO 100000 (1000.00%),
--	And noted the following as the reason for this oddity:
--		The utilization percentage can exceed 100% because the denominator is the non-multicast BW of the PON
--		(calculated as the max PON BW less that reserved for multicast in the QOS cac-profile), 
--		yet the unicast (and broadcast) traffic can use the BW reserved for multicast if it is available.

--	        A value of 2 means that TCA alarms are disabled for this PON/channel-pair.
--		A value of 3 means - INHERIT - Inherits the system-wide TCA setting for the BW Utilization TCAs.  
--			As of ISAM5.2, the value 3 is SUPPORTED for PONs.
--			As of ISAM5.2.01, the value 3 is NOT SUPPORTED for channel-pairs.

--
-- In both gponOltSideOntUtilPmCurrentIntervalTable and gponOltSideOntUtilPmIntervalTable:

--
--
--		0x06 - limited N:P bridge filtering (SUPPORTED as of ISAM5.1.01).

--
--    		0x07 - limited N:MP bridge-map-filtering (SUPPORTED as of ISAM4.4).
--				In this mode, the  VLAN  id in the outermost VLAN tag 
--				egressing from the ONU for different data flows in one 
--				ONU can not be same. It means the different data flows 
--				from users can not be aggregated into same VLAN id in the ONU.
--       	Default = 0x05 = 1:MP

--
--	For following attributes in PonStatsBerTable:
--		bponPonStatsBerUpstream
--		bponPonStatsBerDownstream
--			Described the differences in effective SUPPORT between GPON and X-GPON.
--			(i.e. X-GPON always returns 0 value).
--
--	For bponPonStatsBerResetTrigger attribute in bponPonStatsBerResetTable,

--		For ISAM5.0, JBoyle moved it to { bponPotsGroup 15 }
--
--
-- ALU01848928 - 7342 Feature Gap: PON Utilization Threshold
-- ALU01848930 - 7342 Feature Gap: Multicast Utilization Threshold
-- 		REMOVED all attributes/tables associated with above RCRs (because PLM has moved them into a ISAM5.1+ release,
--		where a database migration is permitted).  The feature is being worked with FTTU4.9+ with Verizon, and it may
--		well take on different characteristics than what was in this MIB (prior to this deletion). Following was deleted:

--
--	Added the following attributes to gponCesServiceTable:

--		gponCesServiceTcpUdpPortNum
--		gponCesServiceDscpSetting

--	For all pre-ISAM4.6 existing attributes in gponCesServiceTable, clarified whether attribute is relevant in following situations:
--		1) only for L2 service
--		2) for both L2 and L3 service
--		3) only for L3 service
--
--	Added following commentary to bponOntIPHCCapability attribute of bponOntTable:
--		As of ISAM4.4, this attribute must be set to 'enable IPHC' in order to configue SNMP agent service using gponIpHostTable.
--		As of ISAM4.6.01, this attribute must be set to 'enable IPHC' in order to configue L3 CES pseudowire service using gponIpHostTable.
--
--	In up-front commentary of gponOntIpHostTable, added the following:
-- 		As of ISAM4.6.01, the VLAN.PORT style usage is also relevant for L3 CES psuedowire service 
--		(since an IpHost instance is necessary for such service).
-- 		For such L3 CES service, this association is inferred between gponCesServiceVlanPointer attribute in 
--		gponCesServiceTable and VLAN.PORT ifIndex style usage in this gponOntIpHostTable.
--
-- 		VALIDATION:  As of ISAM4.6.01, ALU is building an ONT that supports L3 CES pseudowire service.  This ONT does NOT support VoIP service of
--		of any type and does NOT support ONT SNMP agent service that uses an IpHost entry in this table.  So in the real world (so far), it is still
-- 		only necessary to support a single IpHost entry for a single ONT.  And it is also NOT necessary to support legacy VoIP along with
-- 		L3 CES pseudowire service in the same ONT.  But in theory, an ONT could support 'multiple IpHost instances' along with legacy VoIP, etc...
--		In order to step gradually:
--			As of ISAM4.6.01 sill can only configure a single entry in IpHost table for a single ONT.
--			As of ISAM4.6.01 cannot configure both legacy VoIP and any gponOntIpHostTable entry for the same ONT.
-- 
--	Noted that: As of ISAM4.6.01, following tables are relevant for both L2 and L3 CES pseudowire service:
--		gponCesServicePWCurrentIntervalTable		
--		gponCesServicePWIntervalTable
--	Noted that: As of ISAM4.6.01, following tables are NOT supported for L3 CES pseudowire service:
--		gponCesServiceOntsideGemCurrentIntervalTable

-- John Boyle - 2/29/2012
-- For ISAM4.4
--
-- RCR ALU00719164 - OMCI extension: ME for remote MDU mgmt - OLT part
--
--	Updated introductory text of gponOntIpHostTable to account for following:
-- Prior to ISAM4.4, this table was only used for standard VoIP service. For standard VoIP service, rows in this table use the same ifIndex as the 
-- Virtual UNI that is auto-created in the IFM MIB (stemming from appropriate setting of bponOntVoipCapability attribute in bponOntTable).
--
-- As of ISAM4.4, if bponOntIPHCCapability attribute in bponOntTable is set to SUPPORTED then rows in this table
-- can also use the same ifIndex that corresponds to a VLAN.PORT in the IFM MIB.  As of ISAM4.4, the only relevant usage in this manner
-- is for ONT SNMP agent service that uses IP service explicitly configured via this MIB,  Such association is conveyed via corresponding
-- ifIndex value in gponSnmpIpServiceIPHC attribute in gponSnmpIpServiceTable.
--
-- VALIDATION:  As of ISAM4.4, a specific ONT can have at most a single row represented in this table.  Thus, for a specific ONT there
--	can be no conflict regarding the usage format of the ifIndex.
--
-- VALIDATION:  Regarding VoIP for a specific ONT, creation of a row in this table must be MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
-- 	with creation of a row in gponOntVoipServiceTable that would use same ifIndex in Interface MIB 
--	(i.e. either legacy Voip or standard Voip - but not both). 
--
-- VALIDATION:  As of ISAM4.4, for a specific ONT, cannot configure both legacy VoIP service and SNMP agent service that uses IP service 
--	explicitly configured in this MIB.
--
-- 	For gponOntIpHostVlanPointer attribute in gponOntIpHostTable, updated description with following:	
--		 When ifIndex format for table row represents Virtual UNI, then no default is permitted. Legitimate value 
--		 must be supplied by manager.
--		 When ifIndex format for table row represents VLAN.PORT, then default is 0.  
--
-- 	For gponSnmpIpServiceIPHC attribute in gponSnmpIpServiceTable, touched up description as follows:
--		This attribute was introduced with ISAM4.4.
--
--                   	When non-zero, this attribute must point to an appropriate row in gponOntIpHostTable. This would
--	     	be the situation when ONT SNMP agent uses IP service explicitly configured via this MIB.  When used
--	     	in this manner, the ifIndex format must be the appropriate VLAN.PORT ifIndex (for the corresponding row
--	     	in gponOntIpHostTable).
--
--                   	Zero means ONT SNMP agent uses IP service configured internally via VEIP mechanisms.
--                   
--                   	Default = 0 = SNMP over VEIP.
--
--		Modification is SUPPORTED.

-- For gponOntVoipConfigSecureUriPointer attribute in gponOntVoipConfigTable, changed description to say following:
--		 Value 0 (meaning none specified) is permitted.  
--		 This attribute is only relevant if VoipConfigMethod is NOT via OMCI.
--		 If ConfigMethod is via OMCI, then this pointer must be 0.
-- For gponOntVoipConfigRetrieveProfileCmd attribute in gponOntVoipConfigTable, added following clarification:
--		 This command attribute is only relevant if VoipConfigMethod is NOT via OMCI.
-- In gponOntIpHostTable, extended the the deletion validation statement in table intro description to say following:
--	VALIDATION:  A row cannot be deleted if there exists a corresponding row

-- 		or standard SIP.  The legacy versus standard style decision is controlled via the
-- 		bponOntVoipCapability attribute in bponOntVoipTable.  The standard MGC versus 
-- 		standard SIP decision is controlled via mutually exclusive pointers in the 
-- 		bponPotsPortMgcConfigPointer and bponPotsPortSipConfigPointer attributes of this table.
-- 		Once the OLT has sufficient information to clearly know the VoIP agent type selection, it
-- 		should reject SET commands on POTS port attributes that are irrelevant for the known VoIP agent type.

--		 Setting it will result in same behavior as Option 1.
--		 It is recommended that a manager only use Option 1.
--		 
--		 For the majority of cases, the planned version is equal to 
--		 the active version, so setting this attribute will result in a pure reboot.
--		 In rare cases, the ONT may have an error condition where the planned
--		 version is stuck on the passive version (e.g. after a previous activation
--		 failure).  In such a case, setting this attribute will trigger the ONT to 
--		 attempt to activate the passive version.
--
-- For gponOntSwDownldStatus attribute in gponOntSwDownldStatusTable and 
-- gponPonOntSwDownldStatus attribute in  gponPonOntSwDownldStatusTable,

--		 1) Flows are on the same UNI.
--		 2) 'mode'  of the associated S-VLAN (for flows) is NOT 'CVLANLEARN'. 
--		 3) Flows have the same S-VLAN value.
--		 4) Flows reference PQ profiles that have 1 or more overlapping PBits specified (i.e. a PBit clash).
--
--		 RULE3: OLT will REJECT flow creation attempt that would cause ALL of following to be 
--		 	TRUE for 2 or more flows:
--		 1) Flows are on the same UNI.
--		 2) 'mode'  of the associated S-VLAN (for flows) is 'CVLANLEARN'. 
--		 3) Flows have the same S-VLAN value.
--		 4) Flows reference PQ profiles that have 1 or more overlapping PBits specified (i.e. a PBit clash).

--
--
-- John Boyle - 7/30/2008
-- For FGU4.6: 
--
-- For following attributes in gponVoipServiceTable, added the following NOTE:
--		NOTE: The following attributes are tightly related:
--		gponVoipServiceConfigFileName, gponVoipServiceFtpAuthUsername,
--		and gponVoipServiceFtpAuthUsername.  From and OMCI standpoint,
--		all 3 must be sent to the ONT in that order. This applies to initial VoIP
--		Client creation, and subsequently if any one or more of these attributes
--		are edited.
--
--
-- John Boyle - 7/24/2008
-- For FGU4.6: 
--
-- For  gponVoipServicePQProfile attribute in gponVoipServiceTable, removed validation
--	regarding no more than 2 queues (GEM ports).  There are still limitations,
--	but mentioned in context of other attributes (e.g. gponVoipServiceSignalVlanId).
--	Changed description to say following: 		 
--		 For all ONTs (other that older M300),  the referenced PQ Profile should
--		 specify exactly 2 queues (GEM ports).  But the OLT will will not
--		 enforce this check.  If the particular ONT does not support the 
--		 the number of specified queues (GEM ports) for this VoIP service,
--		 it will reject via OMCI and OLT will raise a 'service mismatch alarm'.
--
-- John Boyle - 7/24/2008
-- For FGU4.6: 
--
-- In gponVoipServiceTable, updated constraints and validations in following attributes:
--	- gponVoipServicePQProfile
--	- gponVoipServiceVlanId
--	- gponVoipServiceSignalVlanId
-- These overall additional constraints are the following:
--	- VoIP PQ Profile CANNOT specify more than 2 queues (GEM ports)
--	- If signalling VLAN is same as bearer VLAN, it's the same as pre-4.6
--	  behavior (i.e. like a single S-VLAN).
--	- If signalling VLAN and bearer VLAN are different (other than 4096 value),
--	  then associated PQ Profile must specify exactly 2 queues (GEM ports).
--
--
-- John Boyle - 7/24/2008
-- For FGU4.6: 
--
-- For gponServicePortalUpBwProfile attribute in gponServicePortalTable:
--	- Further constrained so that it is NOT permitted to modify from 
--	  null to non-null or from non-null to null.  Formerly said that this 
--	  restriction was only applicable if portal had an associated flow.
--	  Now we prohibit such modification regardless if portal has an
--	  associated flow.
--
-- John Boyle - 7/9/2008
-- For FGU4.6: 
--
-- For gponServicePortalAdminState attribute in gponServicePortalTable:

-- For FGU4.6: 
--
-- BDFam40872 - ONT Power Burst
--	- Added gponOltPowerBurstDetectMode scalar.
--	- For bponPonDiscovOntDisableIndicator in bponPonDiscovOntTable, added a new 
--	  possible text string so the set is as follows:		
--		  DISABLED - meaning ONT has been told via a PLOAM message to turn off it's laser.
--		  PWRERR - meaning extraneous power bursts have been detected for this ONT.
--		  'null string' (i.e. no text) - meaning none of the above are true.
--
--
-- John Boyle - 6/24/2008
-- For FGU4.6: 
--
-- BDFam31073 - Per Service Throughput Rate Limiting
--	- For gponOltVoipDownstreamSchedMode attribute, specified that 1 = PON-based
--	  setting is only applicable for GLT4 cards.  Such setting is ignored for GLT2 cards,
--	  which will always work as pre-4.6 'ONT-based'. 
--	- For following profile pointer attributes, specified that they must be set to 1 (i.e. the default)
--	  if they are not being used:
--		 bponOntSchedulerProfile in bponOntTable
--		 gponHsiServiceDsRateSchedProfile in gponHsiServiceTable
--		 gponCesServiceDsRateSchedProfile in gponCesServiceTable
--		 gponVoipServiceDsRateSchedProfile in gponVoipServiceTable

--		attribute now takes on the characteristic of being the Planned VoIP Configuration
--		File Name, and that it can be edited by the manager.
--	- Added gponVoipServiceOpInfoActualConfigFileName attribute to the gponVoipServiceOpInfoTable

-- John Boyle - 9/30/2004
-- Made following modifications for FGU2.5:
--	- Added an Operational State attribute to POTS Port
--	   table.
-- 	- Added comments to Operational State atributes for
--	  port related services (e.g. POTS, Ethernet, CES and 
--	  Video). Indicated that Oper State is related to ability of
--	  port to perform its function (e.g. presence/absence of
--	  Service Affecting alarms).
--
--
-- John Boyle - 9/28/2004
-- Made following modifications for FGU2.5:
-- 	- Added comments to various attributes to mention that
--	  following features descoped for FGU2.5:
--		- 802.1P
--		- Structured/Fractional DS1
--	- For Voice Signalling Option in bontTable, combined H248
--	  and MEGACO as same option, and added MGCP as new
--	  option.
--
--
-- John Boyle - 9/20/2004
-- Made following modifications for FGU2.5:
-- 	- For bponOntCountryCode attribute in bponOntTable, 
--	  added Great Britain = 44 as a supported value.
--
--
-- John Boyle - 9/9/2004
-- Made following modifications for FGU2.5:
-- 	- For bponOntCountryCode attribute in bponOntTable, 
--	  changed coding semantics to reflect ITU E.164 instead of
--	  ITU T.35.
--	- Changed semantics for Admin State and Operational State
--	  in both oNUAtmVclTable and oNUAtmVcCrossConnectTable.
--	  Made them consistent with other Admin/Oper state codings
--	  in rest of the APON MIB.
--
--
-- John Boyle - 9/8/2004
-- Made following modifications for FGU2.5:
-- 	- Removed Admin State and Oper State from BponOnt Table.
--	- Made a few notes regarding attributes that are
--	   'Not Supported' for initial FGU2.5.
--	- Made a few notes for various tables regarding whether they
--	   are created dynamically (create-and-go) or statically (i.e.
--	   automatically by OLT) - this is trying to document behavior
--	   that is special for the initial FGU2.5 release.
--	  
--
-- John Boyle - 8/27/2004
-- Made following modifications for FGU2.5:
-- 	- Split ONT card tables into 2 tables: Planned and
--	  Actual.
--	- Changed Country Code assignments to refer to ITU T.35. 
--	- A few other changes stemming from review comments.
--
--	- Created the following tables, which are essentially the same
--	  as old apon Tables - but their prefix has been changed from 
--	  apon to bpon - and their OIDs have been changed to move
--	  them into the appropriate bpon group:
--		1) bponPonConfigGroup
--		2) bponPonDiscovOntTable
--		3) bponLanMacBrdgServProfTable
--		4) bponAtmAal1ProfileTable
--		5) bponCesProfileTable
--
--
-- John Boyle - 7/28/2004
-- Made following modifications for FGU2.5:
-- 	- Clarified the meaning of SpIndex in various tables
--	- Introduced a few new attributes in bponOntTable
--	  (for new OMCI Proprietary message and ONT Type).
--	- A few other changes stemming from review comments
--
-- John Boyle - 5/28/2004
-- Made following modifications for FGU2.5, which was effectively
-- a complete MIB re-write:
--
-- Added 8 new bpon groups (starting at OID 10 in the 
-- overall apon MIB).
--
-- Deleted the following tables (from apon groups) which will
-- no longer be used starting with FGU2.5:
--	1) aponOntEquipTable
--	2) aponPotsVciInterwkTable
--	3) aponPotsMltTable
--	4) aponLanVciInterwkTable

		" As of FGU4.5, this attribute takes on a new meaning. SET of this attribute
		  will cause the OLT to make every attempt to ensure that this version becomes 
		  the active image on the ONT.

		  The special string value UNPLANNED means that any download and activation processing 
		  associated with this attribute is inhibited.  UNPLANNED also means that the OLT will NOT provision this
		  ONT via OMCI with relevant information from the OLT MIB.

		  Modification is permitted even after ONT activation.

		  version (i.e. Version Number) and planned variant have a match in the gponOntSwVerCtlTable,

-- BPON PON CONFIGURATION TABLE

-- For FGU4.0, this table is being re-used.  Comments are

-- For ISAM4.0.10, this table is being re-used.

-- *********************************************
-- The following table is essentially the same as the old 
-- aponPonDiscovOntTable.  However, the prefix of everything was
-- changed from apon to bpon - and the OID was changed to move
-- the table into the appropriate bpon group.  Although not proper,
-- this was done so that the OLT software could reuse as much
-- previous code as feasible, while using bpon prefix for everything.
--
--
-- BPON PON DISCOVERED ONT TABLE
--
--
-- For a specific PON, this table contains the 
-- Serial Numbers (and possibly SLID values) of
-- ONTs that have been auto-discovered via
-- Method B, but have not yet been manually
-- provisioned (i.e. ENTERED)
-- by the operator. In TL1, these are referred to as 
-- NEWONT alarms. The operator does not directly
-- create or delete rows in this table.  The OLT
-- agent automatically manages the creation and
-- deletion of rows. Rows are automatically created
-- when an ONT is auto-discovered on a specific PON.
-- Rows are not automatically deleted just because a
-- NEWONT alarm is cleared (the reason being that the
-- AMS still needs to reference the associated row to
-- determine the Serial Number and SLID for the
-- cleared NEWONT alarm). So, as opposed to fixed
-- rules for deleting entries, the OLT tends to re-use
-- entries as necessary. NEWONT alarms are normally
-- cleared under the following 2 circumstances:
-- 1) An operator (or the system) creates an ONT on a
-- PON (with a Serial Number) that has a match in this
-- table or 2) The OATD informs the OLT that a
-- previously dicovered Serial Number has dis-appeared.
-- This table is used to store ONT information that
-- is required to be displayed with the NEWONT alarm
-- (i.e. ONT's Serial Number and the Subscriber
-- Location ID - SLID). The table indexes (i.e. 
-- bponPonDiscovOntIfIndex and bponPonDiscovOntNum)
-- match up with the Index1 and Index 2 fields 
-- actually contained in the Alarm MIB (for a
-- NEWONT alarm).
--
-- For FGU4.0, this table is being re-used.  Comments are 
-- made regarding whether attribute is relevant to BPON,
-- GPON or both, etc. 
--
-- For ISAM4.0.10, this table is being re-used. 
-- Noted which attributes are relevant for ISAM4.0.10

-- *********************************************

-- BPON POTS PORT TABLE
--
-- This is a new table beginning with FGU2.5.
-- This table contains a row for each provisioned POTS port on a
-- specific ONT. Rows are created dynamically by operator via
-- Create-and-go.  Some parameters are changeable once created.  
--
-- For FGU4.0, this table is being re-used.  Comments are 
-- made regarding whether attribute is relevant to BPON,
-- GPON or both, etc.  
--
-- For ISAM4.0.10, this table is being re-used. However, for ISAM 4.0.10,
-- rows are auto-created by agent.  The number of rows auto-created is
-- determined from the bponOntPlanCardTable.
-- Noted which attributes are relevant for ISAM4.0.10  
-- 
-- For ISAM4.2, this table is being re-used.
-- Noted which attributes are relevant for ISAM4.2 
--
-- VALIDATION: Beginning with ISAM4.2.02, for a specific ONT, a POTS port
-- can be associated with one of the following 3 Voip agent types: legacy, standard MGC,
-- or standard SIP.  The legacy versus standard style decision is controlled via the
-- bponOntVoipCapability attribute in bponOntVoipTable.  The standard MGC versus 
-- standard SIP decision is controlled via mutually exclusive pointers in the 
-- bponPotsPortMgcConfigPointer and bponPotsPortSipConfigPointer attributes of this table.
-- Once the OLT has sufficient information to clearly know the VoIP agent type selection, it
-- should reject SET commands on POTS port attributes that are irrelevant for the known VoIP agent type.
--
-- VALIDATION:  As of ISAM4.3,  bponOntVoipCapability attribute was extended to also support what is
-- known as Veip-style VOIP.  POTS ports (as represented in this table) are also relevant for provisioning
-- when mode is Veip-style VOIP, but only a subset of table attributes are relevant for this mode. Hopefully,
-- the specific relevance is indicated within the individual attribute descriptions within.
--
--	For GPON - SUPPORTED as of ISAM4.0.10
--	For XG-PON1 - SUPPORTED as of ISAM4.6.02
--  For NG-PON2 - SUPPORTED as of ISAM5.4.01
--                Attributes that are only relevant for legacy and/or MEGACO 
--                are not relevant for NG-PON2.

                 This power measurement is a signed integer referred to 1mW (i.e. dBm), with 1 dB granularity.
                 This value (units of dBm) is computed as gponVideoAniOpInfoOpticalSignalLevel (units of dBuW) minus 30.

                 If Signal Capability = 0, 2 or 4 then this attribute is undefined.

                 If Signal Capability = 1, 3, 5 or 7 then this attribute describes the total optical power that is generating photocurrent on the receiver.

                 Range is -30 to +226.

                 +226 = Unknown (because OLT has not yet communicated with ONT for OMCI discovery purposes).

-- CES SERVICE ONT-SIDE GEM PERFORMANCE MONITOR INTERVAL TABLE
--
-- This is a new table beginning with FGU4.3.
-- This interval table contains various GEM port statistics collected
-- at an ONT over the previous 8 hours of operation.  The past 8 hours are
-- broken into 32 completed 15 minute intervals.  Each row in this table
-- represents one such interval associated with an CES service.
--
-- An instance of this table is auto-created/deleted in accordance with the

--
-- NOTE: The ONT itself doesn't have knowledge about the individual GEM
-- ports that comprise an CES Service - this is known only by the OLT.  But 
-- the ONT keeps the GEM PM counts on a GEM port basis.  Therefore, the
-- OLT must collect and sum the individual GEM port PMs for each of the 
-- GEM ports associated with the CES service.  The GEM port PM summations
-- are recorded in this table.
--
-- For ISAM4.0.10, this table is being re-used. 
-- Noted which attributes are relevant for ISAM4.0.10.
--
-- As of ISAM4.6.01, this table is NOT supported for L3 CES pseudowire service.

-- GPON ETHERNET TRAFFIC PERFORMANCE MONITOR  INTERVAL TABLE
--
-- This is a new table beginning with FGU4.2.
-- This interval table contains Ethernet traffic statistics collected
-- at an ONT's data interface over the previous 8 hours of operation.  The past 8 hours are
-- broken into 32 completed 15 minute intervals.  Each row in this table
-- represents one such interval associated with a physical data interface.  
-- The physical data interface could be any of the following:
-- Ethernet, XDSL, HPNA or MoCA.
--
-- An instance of this table is auto-created/deleted in accordance with the 
-- 'Ethernet Traffic PM Collect Indicator' setting of the particular data UNI.
--
-- For ISAM4.0.10, this table is being re-used. 
-- Noted which attributes are relevant for ISAM4.0.10
--
-- For ISAM4.2, extended the table and noted which new attributes are supported.
--
--	For GPON - SUPPORTED as of ISAM4.2
--	For XG-PON1 - SUPPORTED as of ISAM4.6.02
--	For NG-PON2 - SUPPORTED as of ISAM5.2 (For Ethernet UNI only)

-- UNI OLT-SIDE GEM PERFORMANCE MONITOR INTERVAL TABLE
--
-- This is a new table beginning with ISAM4.0.10.
-- This interval table contains various GEM port statistics collected
-- for a Service Flow (OLT-side) over the previous 8 hours of operation.  The past 8 hours are
-- broken into 32 completed 15 minute intervals.  Each row in this table
-- represents one such interval associated with a service flow.
--
-- An instance of this table is auto-created/deleted in accordance with the 
-- 'PM Collect Indicator' setting (for this UNI) in the UNI Gem PM Table.
--
--
-- NOTE: The OLT must collect and sum the individual GEM port PMs for each of the 
-- GEM ports associated with the UNI.  The GEM port PM summations
-- are recorded in this table.
--
-- Prior to ISAM5.0, this table was only SUPPORTED for following:
-- Ethernet and XDSL UNI types
--
-- As of ISAM5.0, this table is SUPPORTED for following:
-- Ethernet, XDSL,HPNA, MOCA and VEIP UNI types.
--
--	For GPON - SUPPORTED as of ISAM4.0.10
--	For XG-PON1 - SUPPORTED as of ISAM4.6.02
--	For NG-PON2 - SUPPORTED as of ISAM5.2 (For Ethernet UNI only)

-- the following are TRUE: 
-- 1) Either Planned SW Version and/or Download SW Version (in ONT Table) are set to AUTO,
-- 2) Actual HW Version and specified SW Variant (in ONT Table) have a match in this table.
-- When such case is TRUE,  the logic behaves as if the appropriate AUTO selection (in ONT Table)
-- was instead replaced by the respective SW Version specified in this table.
-- 3) As of ISAM5.2, the same behavior applies for CfgFile1 and CfgFile2 configuration files.
--
--  Rows are created by the operator.
--
-- NOTE:  A row CANNOT be deleted if currently referenced by at least one ONT that has special
-- value AUTO in either SwPlannedVersion or SwDownloadVersion or similar attributes for either 
-- primary or secondary configuration files.  'Referenced' means that the
-- ONT has a matching HW version and SW Variant in the table.
--
-- For ISAM4.0.10, this table is being re-used. 
-- Noted which attributes are relevant for ISAM4.0.10

-- GPON PON ONT SOFTWARE DOWNLOAD TABLE
--
-- This is a new table beginning with FGU4.6.
--
-- It is used to retrieve (for PON lump-sum) individual ONT fine-grain status 
-- asssociated with any 'SW download activity'.  This table is primarily
-- intended as a aide to a management system (EMS) that prefers polling
-- a status attribute (instead of using the legacy 'alarm processing' mechanism).
-- NOTE:  The term 'download activity' should be interpreted in the broad sense
-- of individual steps necessary to perform 'womb-to-tomb' ONT software 
-- management activity (e.g. retrieval of load from NT file system all the way
-- through ONT activation).
-- 
-- Rows are created/deleted automatically by OLT when the
-- corresponding row is created/deleted in the bponPonConfigTable.
--
--	For GPON - SUPPORTED as of ISAM4.0.10 (CfgFile1 and CfgFile2 are SUPPORTED as of ISAM5.2)

-- This is a new table beginning with ISAM4.2. 
-- It is only SUPPORTED beginning with ISAM4.2.02 release.
--
--
-- This table contains configuration information for an IP stack on the ONT.
-- From an OMCI standpoint, it maps primarily to the IP Host Config Data ME.
-- From an OMCI standpoint, it is implicit that creation of a row in this table also
-- causes creation of Tcp/Udp ME (designated as UDP port 68).
--
-- Prior to ISAM4.4, this table was only used for standard VoIP service. For standard VoIP service, rows in this table use the same ifIndex as the 
-- Virtual UNI that is auto-created in the IFM MIB (stemming from appropriate setting of bponOntVoipCapability attribute in bponOntTable).
--
-- As of ISAM4.4, if bponOntIPHCCapability attribute in bponOntTable is set to SUPPORTED then rows in this table
-- can also use the same ifIndex that corresponds to a VLAN.PORT in the IFM MIB.
--  
-- As of ISAM4.4, the only relevant usage in this manner (i.e. VLAN.PORT) is for ONT SNMP agent service that uses IP service explicitly
-- configured via this MIB,  Such association is conveyed via corresponding ifIndex value in gponSnmpIpServiceIPHC attribute in gponSnmpIpServiceTable.
--
-- As of ISAM4.6.01, the VLAN.PORT style usage is also relevant for L3 CES psuedowire service (since an IpHost instance is necessary for such service).
-- For such L3 CES service, this association is inferred between gponCesServiceVlanPointer attribute in gponCesServiceTable and VLAN.PORT ifIndex 
-- style usage in this gponOntIpHostTable.
--
-- VALIDATION:  As of ISAM4.4, a specific ONT can have at most a single row represented in this table.  Thus, for a specific ONT there
--	can be no conflict regarding the usage format of the ifIndex.
--
-- VALIDATION:  Regarding VoIP for a specific ONT, creation of a row in this table must be MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
-- 	with creation of a row in gponOntVoipServiceTable that would use same ifIndex in Interface MIB 
--	(i.e. either legacy Voip or standard Voip - but not both). 
--
-- VALIDATION:  As of ISAM4.4, for a specific ONT, cannot configure both legacy VoIP service and SNMP agent service that uses IP service 
--	explicitly configured in this MIB.
--
-- VALIDATION:  As of ISAM4.6.01, ALU is building an ONT that supports L3 CES pseudowire service.  This ONT does NOT support VoIP service of
--	of any type and does NOT support ONT SNMP agent service that uses an IpHost entry in this table.  So in the real world (so far), it is still
-- 	only necessary to support a single IpHost entry for a single ONT.  And it is also NOT necessary to support legacy VoIP along with
-- 	L3 CES pseudowire service in the same ONT.  But in theory, an ONT could support 'multiple IpHost instances' along with legacy VoIP, etc...
--	In order to step gradually:
--		As of ISAM4.6.01 sill can only configure a single entry in IpHost table for a single ONT.
--		As of ISAM4.6.01 cannot configure both legacy VoIP and any gponOntIpHostTable entry for the same ONT.
--
--
--
-- NOTE: To clarify terms used in other sections of this MIB, creation of a row in this table for VoIP
--	means that the user has decided to provision VoIP for this ONT using standard style
--	(i.e. NOT legacy style).  
--
--	For GPON - SUPPORTED as of ISAM4.2.02
--	For XG-PON1 - SUPPORTED as of ISAM4.6.02
--  For NG-PON2 - SUPPORTED as of ISAM5.4.01
