			ACCESS not-accessible
			STATUS mandatory
			DESCRIPTION
				"The sipUserAgentTable allows to create a SIP User Agent instance. Such SIP User Agent instance is common to all voice LT boards in the node.
                A SIP User Agent instance needs to be created and administratively  enabled for each Service Gateway (VSP or VAG) that is administratively enable din the access node.
                Up to 16 SIP User Agent instances can be created. (only manual creation is supported).
                As the system supports different Service Gateways with different configuration settings, it is allowed to configure a different signaling/media VLAN per Service Gateway.
                However as the system also supports different Service Gateways sharing the same configuration settings, it is allowed to configured the same signaling/media VLAN for more than 1 Service Gateway.
                Maximum 5 DIFFERENT SIP User Agent contexts allowed (for both, MANUAL IP configuration mode and DHCP configuration mode ) amongst all configured SIP User Agent entries.
                It is allowed to configure the shared or distinct VLAN approach per configured Service Gateway. The system supports maximum 8 signaling VLANS for which flow control is enabled.
                Flow control needs to be enabled for the signaling VLAN as to protect system from SIP flooding.
                It is allowed to configure a different signaling stream p-bit value per Service Gateway.
                It is allowed to configure a different media stream p-bit value per Service Gateway.
                It is allowed to configure the IP address mode as 'manual' or 'DHCP' per Service Gateway.
                The DHCP address mode is only supported for the distributed IP address architecture (7363 MX : centralized IP address architecture) and the shared VLAN approach.
                DHCP options 82 and 120 are supported. For a maximum of 5 SIP User Agents instances the IP and  SIP server (option 120) configuration can be retrieved  via DHCP.
                It is allowed to configure a different IP address mode for each Service Gateway, if each Service Gateway owns a different VLAN.
                It is allowed to configure only 1 IP address mode, shared by all Service Gateways if the same VLAN is shared by all Service Gateways.
                The above mentioned limitations are checked upon changing the administrative state of a SIP User Agent instance from 'down' to 'up'.
                The system will check whether there are more than 5 SIP User Agent instances created for which the administrative status is set to 'UP' AND different configuration settings.
                A SIP User Agent instance is considered different from another previously configured SIP User Agent instance if the configured signaling part and/or the configured media part are different from what has been configured before.
                Signaling part : Signaling VlanId, Signaling Default Gw, Signaling Dscp Mark, Signaling Pbits, Signaling MTU.
                Media part : Media VlanId, Media Default GW, Media Dscp Mark, Media Pbits, Media MTU.
                A SIP User Agent instance is considered  not different from another previously configured SIP User Agent instance if both, the configured signaling part and the configured media part appear in one of the previously configured SIP UA entries.
                In case the number of SIP User Agent instances threshold is exceeded, the administrative 'UP' modification action is rejected. Upon the creation of a SIP User Agent instance with admin state = down, the configured  entry is stored within the NT DB.
                Upon the rejection of the admin state change the configured entry remains stored in the DB.

			SYNTAX SEQUENCE OF SipDialPlanDigitmapEntry
			ACCESS not-accessible
			STATUS mandatory
			DESCRIPTION
				"The SIP Dial Plan Digitmap table allows to configure the digit map patterns that are associated with a dial plan. (Actually 
                only 1 dial plan is supported per Service Gateway).
                The patterns are configured in the sipDialPlanDigitmapValue object.
                A sipDialPlanDigitmap table entry is often called a 'digit map rule'.
                A digit map rule may contain several patterns. Different patterns are separated by the '|' character.
                A pattern must NOT be split over different digit map rules.
                The maximum size of a configured sipDialPlanDigitmapValue object = 100 bytes. This size includes the configured patterns as well as
                the pattern separator(s).
                Once the digitmap configuration has completed, The NT passes the entire digitmap to the digitmap parser hosted at the voice LT board.
                Following restrictions will be checked by the digitmap parser :
                i. The total size of 'allowed' patterns ,of the same type, must NOT EXCEED 4 Kbytes.
                (Actually only the type 'digitmap' is supported.)
                ii. The total amount of patterns matching a dialled digit string must NOT EXCEED 50.

                Actually it is not possible to create sipDialPlanDigitmap table entries with sipDialPlanDigitmapAccessType = 'not-allowed'.

                The operator must create the entire digit map for the VSP or each of the VAGs that are created and activated in 
                the access node. (administrative state =  unlocked) in the sipVSPTable.
                Maximum 16 entire digit maps can be created.

                    remains set to 'ON' till the restarted timer expiry.

                    The receipt of a configuration command to switch the sipTermTestAccessState to 'OFF(2)':

                    1. No other MIB objects can be included in the configuration command that intends to modify the sipTermTestAccessState

                    1) Upon the receipt of a configuration command requesting the sipTermTestAccessState to be switched to 'ON (1)' and 
                    sipTermTestAccessBusyOverwrite set to 'TRUE (1)' : Should there still an active call be ongoing for this SIP termination, 
                    then this call is forcibly dropped and subsequently, the sipTermTestAccessState is switched to 'ON (1)'.

                    sipTermTestAccessBusyOverwrite set to 'FALSE (2)' : Should there still an active call be ongoing for this SIP termination, 
                    then the request to switch on the sipTermTestAccessState gets rejected.

                    The sipTermTestAccessBusyOverwrite object can only be configured in the configuration command that intends to modify the

                    If not specified during the modification of the sipTermTestAccessState from 'OFF (2)' to 'ON(1)', the system assumes that 
                    the sipTermTestAccessBusyOverwrite object is set to the value 'False (2)' (which is the default value).

                    This object is not persistent, which means that its value will be reset to the default value upon a board reset.

                    Upon the expiry of the sipTermTestAccessTimeout timer, the system autonomously changes the sipTermTestAccessState 
                    value to 'OFF (2)'. 

                    1) Should upon the sipTermTestAccessTimeout timer expiry, still a NBLT session be running, then the 
                    sipTermTestAccessTimeout timer gets autonomously RESTARTED with the default/latest configured timer value. 
                    The sipTermTestAccessState remains set to 'ON(1)' till the restarted timer expiry. 

                    2) Should a NBLT session be completed prior to the sipTermTestAccessTimeout timer expiry, then the 
                    sipTermTestAccessTimeout timer gets autonomously RESTARTED with the default/latest configured timer value. 
                    The sipTermTestAccessState remains set to 'ON(1)' till the restarted timer expiry.

                    The sipTermTestAccessTimeout object can only be configured in the configuration command that intends to modify 
                    the sipTermTestAccessState to the value 'ON (1)'. 

                    The sipTermTestAccessTimeout object can be configured in the range [1.. 900] seconds. 
                    Should no configuration input be received for the sipTermTestAccessTimeout object, the default value (900 sec) 
                    gets assumed.

                    Upon the recipt of a configuration command to modify the sipTermTestAccessState to the value 'ON (1)' while the

                    timer is aborted, and a new timer with the default /newly configured value for sipTermTestAccessTimeout is started.

                    This object is not persistent, which means that its value will be reset to the value '0' upon a board reset.

                    When the sipTermTestAccessState equals 'ON (1)', a read operation for the sipTermTestAccessTimeout object will 
                    return the time left before the sipTermTestAccessTimeout timer expires.

					In case the IP@ mode is applied then an IP@ is going to be displayed. Otherwise, in case the DN / FQDN
					mode is applied then an FQDN is going to be displayed.
					An FQDN being displayed has only relevance and can only uniquely define a SIP First Hop server on the
					condition that the Domain Name Service being deployed in the customer's network offers a 1:1 mapping
					between FQDN and A Resource Record : should the DN / FQDN mode been applied to configure the SIP
					Server Table and should the Domain Name Service being deployed in the customer's network offer a 1:N
					mapping between FQDN and A Resource Record, then this object will return an FQDN value. However, due
					to the 1:N mapping between FQDN and A resource Record, this FQDN value will not uniquely identify the SIP
					First Hop server actually being in use by a SIP termination.

				DESCRIPTION
                "The MIB table allowing to configure the Service Gateway.
                The MIB table may contain a single entry (This is called the single Service Gateway approach and the Service Gateway entry is autonomously created by the System) or multiple Service Gateway entries ( This is called the multiple Service Gateway approach and the sipVSPTable contains a Service Gateway entry autonomously created by the system together with 1 or multiple Service Gateway entries manually created by the operator).
                The multiple Service Gateway concepts supports :
                - The multiple Voice Service Provider concept  : to support wholesale in a customer's network i.e.
                multiple voice service providers are connected to the same access network offering their voice service to the voice subscribers.
                - The multiple Virtual Access Gateway concept : to allow the customer to increase gradually the voice service capacity of its voice network by gradually installing additional access gateways (SIP servers) offering the voice service to the new voice service subscriptions. This must be entirely considered in the
  scope of a single voice service provider connected to the access network.
                In any case, upon system start-up, the system autonomously creates a sipVSPTable entry with sipVSPName = vsp1 and admin status = locked.
                The content of this entry (except the sipVSPName) can afterwards be modified by the operator.
                However, this autonomously created entry cannot be deleted by the operator.
                In addition to this autonomously created entry, up to 16 sipVSPTable entries can be manually created by the operator. (Thus the sipVSPTable can contain up to 17 entries)
                However, only maximum 16 service gateways entries can be simultaneously active (admin state = UP).

                The association between a sipVSPTable entry and its related data configured in an entry in the other MIB tables is to be made by means of the name configured in the sipVSPName.
                sipVSPTable.sipVSPName maps to :
                    ->sipUserAgentTable.sipUserAgentProviderName
                    ->sipTerminationTable.sipTerminationProviderName

			DESCRIPTION
			"The entry/entries in the SIP User Agent Access Point Table is/are auto-created by the system with default values upon the creation of an entry in the sipUserAgentTable.
            In case the SIP User Agent Table entry for the autonomously created entry in the sipVspTable is created with the IP config mode set to 'DHCP', then the SIP User Agent Access PointTable entries are created with admin state set to 'up' .
            In case the SIP User Agent Table entry for a manually created entry in the sipVspTable is created with the IP config mode set to 'DHCP', then the SIP User Agent Access PointTable entries are created with admin state set to 'down' .
            Such SIP User Agent Access Point entry is common to all voice LT boards in the node.
            The SIP User Agent Access Point Table contains an entry/entries for each Service Gateway created and administratively enabled in the access node.

            7302/7330 ISAM FTTN :
            1)     sipUAIpAddrPolicy configured as 'distributed' : a SIP User Agent Access Point Table entry is created for each of the planned voice LT boards. The sipUaApAssocSlotId contains the voice LT board's slot id.
            2)     sipUAIpAddrPolicy configured as 'centralised' : a single SIP User Agent Access Point Table entry is created. The sipUaApAssocSlotId contains the NT-A's slot id i.e. 0x1101.

            7363 MX :
            sipUAIpAddrPolicy configured as 'centralised' : a single SIP User Agent Access Point Table entry is created. The sipUaApAssocSlotId contains the slot id of the board (NTIO/NT) at which the signaling IP@ and voice IP@ are configured.

            7367 SX :
            sipUAIpAddrPolicy configured as 'centralised' : a single SIP User Agent Access Point Table entry is created. The sipUaApAssocSlotId contains the slot id of the board (NT) at which the signaling IP@ and voice IP@ are configured.

            Ref. Limitations in the description section of the SIP User Agent Table
            Limitations are checked upon changing the administrative state of a SIP User Agent Access Point entry in the sipUserAgentAccessPointTable from 'down' to 'up'. 
            The system will perform the following checks :
            In case 2 SIP User Agent entries are considered as having the same configuration settings, but for the related SIP User Agent Access Point entries, different signaling  and/or media IP@ are configured, the administrative 'UP' modification action for the SIP User Agent Access Point Table will be rejected.
            In case of the centralized IP@ architecture, the SIP User Agent Access Point entry checks are done at node level.
            In case of the distributed IP@ architecture, the SIP User Agent Access Point entry checks are done at voice LT board level.
            Upon the creation of a SIP User Agent  Access Point entry with admin state = down, the configuration  entry is stored within the NT DB.
            Upon the rejection of the admin state change the configured entry remains stored in the DB.

                        " The port seizure time for outgoing call attempts. This counter is only applicable to the outgoing call attempts whereby  the subscriber dials a valid digit before the starting dial timer expiry. (With valid digit is to be understood a digit that at least partially matches one digit map pattern in the configured digit map.)
                        This counter is not applicable to outgoing call attempts that are abnormally ended due to a subscriber action (before the starting dial timer expiry)  or  whereby no dial tone could be put at the line or whereby the system interrupts the outgoing call attempt before the subscriber is even able to dial a first digit.

                        Basic call :
                        The port seizure time is measured from the receipt of the off-hook event till the receipt of the first valid dialed digit.

                        Conference call :  
                        The port seizure time is measured from the moment the MSAN requests the HW to put special dial tone at the line till the receipt of the first valid dialed digit.

                        Call Transfer : 
                        Two types of the Call Transfer Service are supported : the UNATTENDED call transfer service and the ATTENDED call transfer service. 

                        Unattended Call Transfer Service : 
                            Subscriber A establishes a basic call with subscriber B.
                            Subscriber A performs flash hook and dials  service SOC followed by DN of C. 
                            This causes subscriber A to enter the releasing state. Ringing tone is put on the line of subscriber C.
                            When C goes off-hook, a basic call is established between subscribers B and C. 
                            For subscriber A, transferring the call to subscriber C, outgoingCallSeizureDur is measured
                                   from the receipt of the flash hook till the receipt of the first valid dialed digit.

                        Attended Call Transfer Service :
                            Subscriber A establishes a basic call with subscriber B.
                            Subscriber A performs flash hook and dials subscriber C's DN.
                            Ringing tone is put on subscriber C's line.
                            Subscriber C goes off-hook and subscribers B and C are connected.
                            Subscriber A performs flash hook and dials SOC.
                            A basic call is established between subscribers B and C. Subscriber A is put in releasing state.
                            For subscriber A, transferring the call to subscriber C, outgoingCallSeizureDur is measured from the receipt of the flash hook till the receipt of the first valid dialed digit.

                        Call Forwarding :
                            Subscriber A did activate Call Forwarding to subscriber B.
                            Subscriber C goes off-hook and dials subscriber A's DN.
                            Ringing tone is put on subscriber B's line. 
                            Subscriber B goes off-hook; a basic call is established between subscribers C and B. 
                            For subscriber C outgoingCallSeizureDur is measured from the receipt of the off-hook event till the receipt of the first valid dialed digit.

Thus the counter will be increased for the first SIP INVITE request been received as well as for the subsequent SIP INVITE retries been received.

                        Call Transfer :
                        Two types of the Call Transfer Service are supported : the UNATTENDED call transfer service and the ATTENDED call transfer service.
             
                        Unattended Call Transfer Service :
                            Subscriber A establishes a basic call with subscriber B.
                            Subscriber A performs flash hook and dials service SOC followed by C's DN.
                            This causes subscriber A to enter the releasing state. Ringing tone is put on the line of subscriber C.
                            When C goes off-hook, a basic call is established between subscribers B and C.
                            For subscribe C, the called subscriber, it is considered a basic call process.
                                 For subscriber B incomingCallSeizureDur is measured from the moment the ringing tone is put at subscriber B's line till the receipt of the off-hook event. (subscriber A calls subscriber B).

                        Call Forwarding :
                        The system supports 3 types of Call Forwarding :  Call Forwarding Unconditional, Call Forwarding No Reply and Call Forwarding Busy.
             
                        Call Forwarding Unconditional : (all incoming calls are unconditionally forwarded)
                            Subscriber A has enabled Call Forwarding Unconditional to subscriber B.
                            Subscriber C goes off-hook and dials subscriber A's DN; The line of subscriber B will be ringing.
                            Subscriber B goes off-hook; A basic call is  established between subscribers B and C. 
                                 For subscriber B, incomingCallSeizureDur is measured from the moment the ringing tone is put at subscriber B's line till the receipt of the off-hook event. (subscriber C calls subscriber B).
                                 For subscriber A, no port seizure time is measured.
             
                        Call  Forwarding No Reply : (an incoming call is forwarded on the condition that it gets not answered by the called subscriber)
                            Subscriber A has enabled Call Forwarding No Reply to subscriber Line B.
                            Subscriber C goes off-hook and dials subscriber A's DN; The line of subscriber A will be ringing.
                            Subscriber A does not go off-hook upon timer expiry; Call is forwarded to subscriber B; The line of subscriber B is ringing.
                            Subscriber B goes off-hook; a basic call is established between subscribers B and C.
                                For subscriber A, incomingCallSeizureDur is measured from the moment the ringing tone is
                                     put at subscriber A's line till the expiry of the (Call forwarding No Reply) No Answer Timeout. (Ringing tone is stopped at subscriber A's line)
                                 For subscriber B, incomingCallSeizureDur is measured from the moment the ringing tone is
                                     put at subscriber B's line till the receipt of the off-hook event. (subscriber C calls subscriber B).
                        
                        Call Forwarding Busy case :
                            Subscriber A has enabled Call Forwarding Busy to subscriber B.
                            Subscriber A goes off-hook and establishes a call to subscriber D.
                            Subscriber C goes off-hook and dials subscriber A's DN; The line of subscriber B will be ringing.
                            Subscriber B goes off-hook; a basic call is established between the subscribers B and C.

Such registration state change is not explicitly notified to the MSAN (unless the reg event package would be supported and subscribed by the MSAN, which is actually not the case).
                        The total amount of time that from an MSAN point of view, a SIP termination is considered to be successfully registered at the IMS core,  may be different from that same SIP termination to be successfully registered from an IMS core point of view.
                        When the MSAN considers a SIP termination to be successfully registered at the IMS core, its operational state is set to UP.
                        When the MSAN considers a SIP termination not to be registered at the IMS core, its operational state is set to down.
                        The port registration duration counter of a particular SIP termination shall start counting upon the receipt of the 200 OK to the initial registration request for that same SIP termination.
                        The registerDur counting for a particular SIP termination shall stop  :
                         upon the receipt of the 200 OK to the de-registration request for that same SIP termination.
                            (A de-registration request is sent as a consequence of the following actions : SIP Termination Admin state change from up to down, SIP User Agent Admin state change from up to down, SIP User Agent Access Point Admin state change from up to down, VSP Admin state change from up to down, Ground key / Port High temperature alarm raised at the port, ...etc.)
                         Upon Fail-back, requiring a de-register of the SIP terminations at the secondary SIP server.
                         Upon Deliberate Update, requiring a de-register of the SIP terminations at the current Primary SIP server.
                         Upon the receipt of an error response to a SIP RE-REGISTER request, with one of the following error codes: 408 (Request Timeout), 500 (Server Internal Error), 503 (Service Unavailable), 504 (Server Time-Out) or 600 (Busy Everywhere) response.
                         Upon the detection of a non-recoverable error requiring a fail-over and requiring a new initial registration to be done to the secondary SIP server.
                         Upon the receipt of an error response to a SIP INVITE request, with an error code for which the SSP has been provisioned with an error-code clause that, as recovery action,  requires a new initial register to be sent.
                        It shall be noted that in case the SIP termination is still registered at the IMS while its operational state at the MSAN side is set to disabled (meaning that the MSAN considers that same SIP termination as being NOT registered ) or no longer configured, that upon the receipt of an incoming SIP Invite request for that same SIP
                        termination the following error response is returned :
             
                        INVITE(User-x)  404 Not Found       user-x is not configured (user not linked to any SIP termination )

            " The total amount of time that from an MSAN point of view, the SIP terminations configured at a voice LT
                board are considered to be successfully registered at the IMS core.
                Usually the MSAN registers or de-registers a SIP termination to the IMS core. However, it should be noted that
                a registration can also autonomously be deleted by the IMS core.  Such registration state change is not
                explicitly notified to the MSAN (unless the reg event package would be supported and subscribed by the
                MSAN, which is actually not the case).
                The total amount of time that from an MSAN point of view, a SIP termination is considered to be successfully
                registered at the IMS core,  may be different from that same SIP termination to be successfully registered from
                an IMS core point of view.
                When the MSAN considers a SIP termination to be successfully registered at the IMS core, its operational state
                is set to UP.
                When the MSAN considers a SIP termination not to be registered at the IMS core, its operational state is set to
                down.
                The port registration duration counter of a particular SIP termination shall start counting upon the receipt of
                the 200 OK to the initial registration request for that same SIP termination.
                The registerDur counting for a particular SIP termination shall stop  :
                 upon the receipt of the 200 OK to the de-registration request for that same SIP termination.
                (A de-registration request is sent as a consequence of the following actions : SIP Termination Admin
                state change from up to down, SIP User Agent Admin state change from up to down, SIP User Agent
                Access Point Admin state change from up to down, VSP Admin state change from up to down, Ground
                key / Port High temperature alarm raised at the port, ...etc.)
                 Upon Fail-back, requiring a de-register of the SIP terminations at the secondary SIP server.
                 Upon Deliberate Update, requiring a de-register of the SIP terminations at the current Primary SIP server.
                 Upon the receipt of an error response to a SIP RE-REGISTER request, with one of the following error codes:
                408 (Request Timeout), 500 (Server Internal Error), 503 (Service Unavailable), 504 (Server Time-Out)
                or 600 (Busy Everywhere) response.
                 Upon the detection of a non-recoverable error requiring a fail-over and requiring a new initial registration
                to be done to the secondary SIP server.
                 Upon the receipt of an error response to a SIP INVITE request, with an error code for which the SSP has
                been provisioned with an error-code clause that, as recovery action,  requires a new initial register to
                be sent.
                It shall be noted that in case the SIP termination is still registered at the IMS while its operational state at the
                MSAN side is set to disabled (meaning that the MSAN considers that same SIP termination as being NOT
                registered ) or no longer configured, that upon the receipt of an incoming SIP Invite request for that same SIP
                termination the following error response is returned :
         
                INVITE(User-x)  404 Not Found               user-x is not configured (user not linked to any SIP termination )

                    The system allows to do the provisioning in the following way :
                    (1) Method 1 : a separate entry is created for each of the transport protocols to be supported 
                    by the system for the Service Gateway. 
                    (2) Method 2 : a single entry is created enabling all transport protocols to be supported by the 
                    system for the Service Gateway. This method can only be used if the system can listen to the 
                    same transport protocol port for all transport protocols enabled by this entry. 
                    (3) Method 3 : A mix of method 1 and method 2.
                                        
                    R4.3 and following releases  implementation restriction :
                    The Common SIP Voice Call Control Package does only support UDP and TCP as underlying transport protocol for SIP.

                    The flexibility to have also method 1 and method 3 supported is intended for (a) future releases of the
                    Common SIP Voice Call Control Package.
                                                                        
                    The operator must create a transport protocol entry for each Service Gateway created and activated
                    in the access node (administrative state = unlocked).
                    Maximum 16 entries can be created in the sipTransportTable.

            Note : Operational State = 'Down (2)' may be caused by :
            Admin state of the SIP termination set to 'down' by the operator.
            Admin state of the SIP termination set to 'up' by the operator but the SIP termination is not (successfully) registered (yet).
            Admin state of the SIP termination set to 'up' by the operator but the SIP termination's line is in alarm state.

			DESCRIPTION 
			"This object returns either the IP@ or the FQDN of the First Hop SIP server currently in use by the SIP Termination Group. 
            Whether an IP@ or FQDN is going to be displayed depends on the mode been applied to configure the SIP Server Table and the DNS 
            zone file tree structure uploaded to the DNS server. 
            In case the IP@ mode is applied then an IP@ is going to be displayed. 
            In case the configuration mode is FQDN with 1:1 mapping between FQDN and A record, the system shows the FQDN. 
            In case the configuration mode is FQDN with 1:N mapping between FQDN and A record, the system shows the currently used IP@.

            An FQDN being displayed has only relevance and can only uniquely define a SIP First Hop server on the condition that the Domain Name 
            service being deployed in the customer's network offers a 1:1 mapping between FQDN and A Resource Record. 
            Ahould the DN / FQDN mode been applied to configure the SIP Server Table and should the Domain Name Service being deployed in 
            the customer's network offer a 1:N mapping between FQDN and A Resource Record, then this object will return an IP@. 
            Due to the 1:N mapping between FQDN and A resource Record, an FQDN value will not uniquely identify the SIP First Hop server actually 
            being in use by a SIP termination Group.

                ON (1) : The line of the PRA ISDN or R2 CAS SIP termination is exclusively reserved to run NBLT. Incoming and outgoing call attempts are blocked for this PRA ISDN or R2 CAS SIP termination for as long as the TestAccessState remains set to 'ON'.
                OFF (2) : The line of the PRA ISDN or R2 CAS SIP termination can handle incoming and outgoing call attempts (On the condition that there is no other reason to block the PRA ISDN or R2 CAS SIP termination e.g. an ongoing NBLT) and can also handle NBLT requests.

                The  actual administrative / operational / test status of the PRA ISDN or R2 CAS SIP termination does not have any influence on the    setting of the TestAccessState, i.e. this object can be changed at any time from the moment the PRA ISDN or R2 CAS SIP termination has been created.

                The receipt of a configuration command to switch the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState to 'ON(1)':
                1. Only the MIB objects sipIsdnCasTerminationBusyOverWrite and sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAcessTimeout can be included in the configuration command that intends to modify the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState to the value 'ON (1)'.
                2. Should upon the receipt of the configuration command the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState value equals 'OFF (2)', then  the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState is changed to 'ON (1)' and a timer with the default/configured value of sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAcessTimeout is started.
                3. Should upon the receipt of the configuration command the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState value equals 'ON (1)', then the currently running sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAcessTimeout timer gets aborted and a new timer will be started with the default/newly configured  sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAcessTimeout timer.
                4. Upon the expiry of the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAcessTimeout timer, the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState value changes to 'OFF(2)'.
                5. Should upon the expiry of the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAcessTimeout timer, a NBLT test still be running, the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAcessTimeout timer is re-started and the ISDN NBLT test continues till completion. The sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState remains set to 'ON' till the restarted timer expiry.

                The receipt of a configuration command to switch the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState to 'OFF(2)':
                1. No other MIB objects can be included in the configuration command that intends to modify the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState   to the value 'OFF(2)'.
                2. Should upon the receipt of the configuration command the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState value equals 'ON (1)' and no NBLT test being running then the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState is changed to 'OFF (2)' and the running timer gets aborted.
                3. Should upon the receipt of the configuration command the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState value equals 'ON (1)' and a   NBLT test still being running then the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState is changed to 'OFF (2)' and the running timer gets aborted. However, incoming and outgoing calls remain blocked till the running NBLT session has completed.
                4. Should upon the receipt of the configuration command the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState value equals 'OFF (2)', then  the configuration command is ignored.

                The sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState object is not persistent, which means that its value will be reset to the default value upon a board reset.

                Otherwise, should the sipIsdnCasTerminationTestAccessState value equals 'OFF (2)' a read operation for the sipIsdnCasTerminationBusyOverWrite

                      configured according to a predetermined order. The position of the key words and 
                      configurable values may be different depending on the manipulation rule type.
                      A template shall be defined for each manipulation rule type. Key words and 
                      allowed configurable values shall be defined per template.
                      The following rule types are supported whereby only 1 rule type can be configured for a rule :
                      1)  [outg-use-default-pbx-number:numericvalue]
                         The manipulation rule consists of a fixed character string 'outg-use-default-pbx-number:' including
                         the hyphens and the colon. It is immediately followed by a numeric value with a  range [0,1]. 
                           '0': Don't replace the calling number by the 'pilot number' when it is invalid. 
                           '1': Replace the calling number by the 'pilot number' even when it is invalid.
                         It is not allowed to insert a space between the fixed character string and the numeric value.
                         e.g.  configure voice sip manipulate-rule 1 rule outg-use-default-pbx-number:0 admin-status enabled 
                      2)  [inc-add-phone-context-to-number]
                         The manipulation rule consists of a fixed character string 'inc-add-phone-context-to-number'
                         including the hyphens. This rule type does not require the country code to be configured as part of the manipulation rule.
                         .e.g. configure voice sip manipulate-rule 1 rule inc-add-phone-context-to-number admin-status enabled 
                      3)  [outg-add-country-area-code-in-phone-context:countrycode-areacode]
                         The manipulation rule consists of a fixed character string 'outg-add-country-area-code-in-phone-context:'
